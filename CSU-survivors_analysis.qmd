cormat_subjective %>%

  kable(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c'),
        digits = c(NA, NA, 3, 3, 3, 3),
        caption = 'Numeric equivalent of Figure S3', 
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

cormat_physbehav %>%
  dplyr::select(Parameter1, Parameter2, rho, CI_low, CI_high, p) %>%
  kable(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c'),
        digits = c(NA, NA, 3, 3, 3, 3),
        caption = 'Numeric equivalent of Figure S4', 
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

- Average daily step count, time in sedentary behavior, time in light activity, time in moderate-to-vigorous activity, and time in stepping bouts over 1 minute all exhibited significant intercorrelations (*p*s < `r max_p_objective`) 

- Weighted median cadence in stepping bouts over 1 minute exhibited significant correlations with 2 of the measures of real-world behavior (*p*s < `r max_p_cadence$max_p`) but was not significantly correlated with sedentary time, time in light activity, time in moderate-to-vigorous activity, or step count (see table above)

- Peak 30s cadence was significantly with 4 measures of real-world behavior (*p*s < `r max_p_30scadence$max_p`) but was not significantly correlated with sedentary time or time in light activity (see table above)


## Most measures of real-world physical behavior were not associated with self-reported well-being or physical function

```{r figure1, fig.cap = 'Figure 1'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figure1_final.png'))

```

```{r}

cormat_all %>%
  dplyr::select(Parameter1, Parameter2, rho, p) %>%
  kable(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c'),
        digits = c(NA, NA, 3, 3),
        caption = 'Numeric equivalent of Figure 1', 
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

- The various measures of real-world physical behavior were not significantly correlated with FACT-G total well-being (*p*s >= `r min_p_objective_factgtotal`)

- Average daily time in stepping bouts over 1 minute was significantly correlated with FACT-G physical well-being, FACT-G physical well-being 5-item subset, and linked PROMIS-PF T-scores (see table above), but no other measures were associated with FACT-G physical well-being, FACT-G physical well-being 5-item subset, or PROMIS-PF T-scores (*p*s >= `r round(min_p_objective_promis_factgphys, 3)`)


```{r figureS5, fig.cap = 'Figure S5'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figureS5_final.png'))

```

```{r}

df_pcor %>%
  dplyr::select(Parameter1 = var1, Parameter2 = var2, rho = estimate, p = p.value) %>%
  kable(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c'),
        digits = c(NA, NA, 3, 3),
        caption = 'Numeric equivalent of Figure S5', 
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

- When accounting for the effects of demographics and cancer characteristics on these associations using a partial Spearman correlation framework, the pattern of significance was largely unchanged, except that the correlation between time in stepping bouts over 1 minute and FACT-G physical well-being was no longer significant (see table above)

- Using the partial correlation framework, no other measures of physical behavior were significantly correlated FACT-G physical well-being, FACT-G physical well-being 5-item subset, or linked PROMIS-PF T-scores (ps >= `r round(min_p_objective_promis_factgphys_partial, 3)`)


```{r figure2, fig.cap = 'Figure 2'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figure2_final.png'))

```
```{r figureS6, fig.cap = 'Figure S6'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figureS6_final.png'))

```

## Real-world physical behavior was associated with aerobic fitness

- All but one of the accelerometry-derived measures of real-world physical behavior were significantly correlated with submaximal VO2 (*p*s <= `r max_p_objective_vo2`)

## Aerobic fitness was not associated with self-reported well-being or physical function

- Spearman correlation analyses indicated that predicted VO2 was not significantly correlated with FACT-G total well-being, FACT-G physical well-being, FACT-G physical well-being 5-item subset, or linked PROMIS-PF T-scores (*p*s >= `r round(min_p_vo2_subjective, 3)`)

- The pattern of significance was unchanged when using a partial correlation approach to account for the effects of demographic and cancer characteristics on these associations (*p*s >= `r round(min_p_vo2_subjective_partial, 3)`)

## Associations with real-world physical behavior were stronger for aerobic fitness than for self-reported well-being or physical function

```{r figure3, fig.cap = 'Figure 3'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figure3_final.png'))

```


## Results of activity fragmentation analyses

### Activity fragmentation was associated with aerobic fitness, but not with self-reported well-being or physical function 

```{r figureS7, fig.cap = 'Figure S7'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figureS7_final.png'))

```

```{r}

cormat_AF_subj_vo2 %>%
  dplyr::select(Parameter1, Parameter2, rho, p) %>%
  kable(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c'),
        digits = c(NA, NA, 3, 3),
        caption = 'Numeric equivalent of Figure S7A', 
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

```{r}

df_pcor_af  %>%
  dplyr::select(var1, var2, estimate, p.value) %>%
  kable(align = c('l', 'l', 'c', 'c'),
        digits = c(NA, NA, 3, 3),
        caption = 'Numeric equivalent of Figure S7B', 
        booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_paper(full_width = FALSE)

```

### Activity fragmentation was more associated with aerobic fitness than with self-reported well-being and physical function

```{r figureS8, fig.cap = 'Figure S8'}

include_graphics(here('figures', 'figureS8_final.png'))

```
